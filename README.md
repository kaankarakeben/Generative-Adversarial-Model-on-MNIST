# Generative-Adversarial-Model-on-MNIST

Applying a generative adversarial model on MNIST Dataset

This project aims to generate images that represent hand-written digits by imitating the samples in MNIST database. 

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework. They were introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014.[1] This technique can generate photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics (though in tests people can tell real from generated in many cases).
